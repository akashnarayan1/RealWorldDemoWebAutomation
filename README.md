# Selenium Cucumber Framework

---

## Project Purpose
This project aims to give an inspiring or sample of automation test framework that uses Selenium and Cucumber with Java as the programming language.
This project uses a medium clone web application https://demo.realworld.io/#/


## Tools and Libraries
* This project uses 2 main tools, Selenium and Cucumber.
* We are using [WebDriverManager](https://bonigarcia.dev/webdrivermanager/)
* [WebDriverManager](https://bonigarcia.dev/webdrivermanager/) is an open-source Java library that carries out the management (i.e., download, setup, and maintenance) of the drivers required by [Selenium WebDriver] (https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/) (e.g., chromedriver, geckodriver, msedgedriver, etc.) in a fully automated manner
* Other tools include - Maven, Log4J, Extent Reports, Faker, etc.
* The complete list of tools, you can see in the `pom.xml` file.

## Requirements
* Java Development Kit
* Maven
* WebDriver, using ChromeDriver

## Running Tests
* Clone the repository from your fork to this directory
* Open the project using any Java IDE
* Run the tests with the script below
```shell
$ mvn clean install
```
* If you want to run the specific test, use the cucumber tags like this
```shell
$ mvn clean install -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@REPLACE_WITH_ANY_TAGS_THAT_YOU_WANT"
```

## Test Results
* Test report automatically generated on `reports` folder after finished the test execution
* See test report from `reports/ExtentReportResults.html`
* You can also share your Cucumber Report with another person at https://reports.cucumber.io, just go to `src/test/resources/cucumber.properties` then change the value to be `true`
```properties
cucumber.publish.enabled=true
```
* For more information about reports cucumber you can go to https://reports.cucumber.io/docs/cucumber-jvm
* For every failing test a screenshot will be captured and saved under 'reports/screenshots' folder
